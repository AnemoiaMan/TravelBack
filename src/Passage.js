On the 20th of August, I was introduced to that 
celebrated character, Thomas Paine. He was confined in 
New York by a hurt in his leg, and lived in the house of 
a Mrs. Palmer, widow of the late deistical minister in that 
city. The gentleman who introduced me was well 
acquainted with Mr. Paine, and I was politely received as 
his friend. Paine was sitting in a small apartment, with 
a number of newspapers before him, and he gave one of 
them to my friend to read some paragraphs relative to the 
negotiations for peace, between Britain and France. In 
iic mean time, I cast my eyes across the table, and, from 
some MSS. which lay on it, judged he was writing on 
the subject of religion. The title of one of the pieces was 
singular, namely, " It is I, Thomas Paine, that speaketh." 
I could only see a word here and there of what followed ; 
but, by the scope of it, I presumed that it was some sort 
of religious creed. I was afterwards informed, that it 
really was so, and that he intended it should be published 
after his death. When my friend had finished reading the 
newspapers, they entered into conversation, in which Paine 
declared decidedly, that there would be no peace. " The 
war," he observed, " must inevitably go on till the go- 
vernment of England fell; for it was radically and 
systematically wrong, and altogether incompatible with the 
of society." I reminded him, that there was now a 
whig administration in Britain, who would institute a reform 
of abuses, cause the constitution to be acted on in its purity, 
and probably repair all the mischief that had been done by the
Tory administrations. He shook his head, and said that he knew 
the Englishgovernment well, and was convinced that no man, or set 
of men, would ever be able to reform it; the system was wrong, 
and it never would be set right without, a revolution, 
which was as certain as fate, and at no great distance in 
time. 

Finding we differed on this point, I changed the subject, 
and took notice of a little essay which he had written 
on the yellow fever, which had been published in the 
newspapers, and attracted considerable attention in the 
southern states. He seemed to be pleased with this, and, 
in the course of conversation on the subject, discovered 
a good deal of that literary vanity of which he has been 
accused; but it must be acknowledged, that this little 
piece contains much valuable information. The argu- 
ments are ingenious ; to me, indeed, quite convincing ; 
and I have conversed with some of Mr. Paine's most stre- 
nuous political opponents, who have viewed them in the 
same light. 

Paine is a slender man, rather tall, and has an 
uncommonly penetrating eye. His face is subject to a scorbutic 
eruption, which circumstance has probably contributed to 
propagate the report, that he is habitually intemperate ; 
but I was informed by those who know him well, that it 
is not correct. When he meets with a person of his own 
way of thinking, he will frequently indulge himself to a 
late hour over a glass of toddy; but seldom carries it to 
excess. His income is but small; but he is in independent 
circumstances, having a tract of land, for which he could 
obtain ten thousand dollars. He is pleasant in conversation, 
and speaks very much in the style he writes, 
quite clear and perspicuous.

In pursuance of the recommendation of my friends, I set out, 
this morning, at 8 o'clock, for the purpose of waiting on
Mr. Jefferson. On my arrival at the president's house, I 
delivered my address to a servant, who in a few minutes 
returned with an answer, that Mr. Jefferson would be with me 
presently, and showed me into an elegant apartment. 

Mr. Jefferson soon entered by an inner door, and 
requesting me to be seated, satdown himself; and immediately, 
and very frankly, entered into conversation, by asking where 
I had ,landed, and how long I had been in the country. 
Having informed him, he remarked that I would probably be 
traveiling to the northward; I replied that I had been 
to the north, and was now travelling to the southward. 
"And how do you like New York ?" "Very much," said I; 
"it is one of the finest seaports I have seen, and, I presume, 
will always continue to be the first commercial city 
in the United States." He observed that he found that 
idea generally entertained by strangers; that New York 
was a very fine situation, and would unquestionably continue 
always to be a great commercial city ; but it appeared to 
him that Xorfolk would probably, in process of time, be the 
greatest sea-port in the United States, New Orleans 
perhaps excepted. 

He pointed out the circumstance of the vast confluence of waters, 
that constituted the outlet of the Chcsupcak bay, on which Norfolk is 
situ-ated, and remarked that these rivers were as yet but 
partially settled ; but they were rapidly settling up, and, when 
the population was full, the quantity of surplus produce 
would be immense, and Norfolk would probably become 
the greatest depot in the United States, except New Orleans.

The conversation next turned upon the climate and season; 
on which the president remarked, that the country had 
this summer been remarkably healthy; that no case of 
epidemical sickness had come to his knowledge, some few 
of bilious fever and fiver and ague excepted, at the foot of 
the mountains on James' river, not far from where he lived; 
and which country was never known to experience any 
cases of the kind before. As this appeared singular, I 
inquired whether there was any way of accounting for it. 
He replied, that the way he accounted for it was this: 
"In ordinary seasons, there is a sufficiency of water to keep 
the rivers in a state of circulation, and no more; but this 
season there has been a long and very severe drought, 
which, in many places, lias dried them up. The water 
lias stagnated in pools, and sends out a putrid effluvia to 
some distance; which, being lighter than the atmosphere, 
ascends even some little way up the mountains, and reaches 
,the abodes of those who thought themselves heretofore 
free from attack.‚Äù

I was struck with the force of this remark, and applied 
it to a circumstance that had come under my observation 
at Washington. The Capitol Hill is elevated above the 
river upwards of 70 feet. Between this and the river there 
is a low meadow, about a mile broad, abounding with
swamps and small shrubbery. In the autumn these swamps 
send out an effluvia, which often affects the health of those 
who live on the hill. I noticed this circumstance, and the 
president remarked, that it was a case exactly in point. He 
said he had frequently observed from his windows, in the 
morning, the vapour to rise, and it seemed to have suffi- 
cient buoyancy to carry it to the top of the hill, and no 
further; there it settled, and the inhabitants, coming out 
of their warm rooms, breathed this cold contaminated va- 
ipour, which brought on agues and other complaints. He 
said he had frequently pointed out this to the people, and 
urged them to drain the swamp, but it was still neglected, 
although they had, besides suffering in their health, proba- 
bly expended more in doctor's bills than it would have 
cost. "But, indeed," he continued, " mankind are exceedingly 
slow in adopting resolutions to prevent disease, and 
it is very difficult to convince them where they origi- 
nate; particularly when the reasoning applied is the re- 
sult of philosophical deduction."

The transition from this subject to that of the yellow 
fever was natural, and I introduced it by noticing Paine's 
essay on the subject. The president observed, that it was 
one of the most sensible performances on that disease, 
that had come under his observation. The remarks were 
quite philosophical, and, not being calculated to excite any 
party-feeling, they might have a very useful tendency. 

He then made a few remarks on the nature of the yellow 
fever itself. He observed, that it evidently arose from 
breathing impure air, and impure air may be either gene- 
rated in the country or imported. A case had come un- 
der his observation where it was imported. A vessel ar- 
rived at Norfolk, and the air in t her hold was so pestilen- 
tial, that every person who went into it was affected, and 
some of them died; but, on the discovery being made, 
the vessel was purified, and the fever did not spread. This 
was a local circumstance, he observed, and there may be 
many others, which are pernicious as far as they go, and 
care should be taken to prevent them. But a ship can 
never import a sufficient quantity of impure air to pollute 
a whole city, if that city be otherwise healthy, and, there- 
fore, the origin of the yellow fever, on an extended scat 
must be sought for in an impure air, generated from filt 
collected in and about great cities ; and it was very expe- 
dient that this view of the subject should be enforced, in 
order to induce mankind to attend to one of the most im- 
portant concerns in life cleanliness. 

I took notice of the bad state of the road between Bal- 
timore and Washington, and expressed my surprise that 
it should remain in this state, so near the capital of the 
United States. The president observed, that the removal ; 
of the seat of government was a recent measure, and the 
country was so extensive, that it would necessarily be a 
considerable time before good roads could be made in all 
directions, but as it was a most important subject, it 
would be attended to as fast as circumstances would per- 
mit; and the road to Baltimore, being the great thorough- 
fare to the northern states, would probably be one of the 
first that would undergo a thorough repair. He then informed 
me, that both this subject and that of internal na- 
vigation by canals, were under consideration at the present 
time, upon a very extended scale, and probably a report 
would soon be published relative to them ; and he had 
little doubt, but that in less than 20 years, turnpike roads 
would be general throughout the country ; and a chain of 
canals would probably be cut, which would complete an 
inland navigation from Massachusetts to Georgia; and 
another to connect the eastern with the western waters.

I remarked that these would be most important im- 
provements, and would greatly facilitate internal inter- 
course; and as to manufactures, I presumed it would long 
continue to be the policy of the country to import them. 
He replied, that this, like other branches, would of course 
find its level, and would depend upon the genius of the 
people; but it was astonishing, the progress that had been 
made in manufactures of late years. It would hardly be 
believed, he said, by strangers, but he had it on the best 
authority, that the manufactures of Philadelphia were 
greater in value annually, than were those of Birmingham 
20 years ago; and he had no doubt but that manufactures, 
of articles of the first necessity, would increase until they 
became quite general through the country. 

As the non-importation act was then in dependence, I 
was naturally anxious to ascertain, whether matters were 
likely to be adjusted with Britain, and, as modestly as 
possible, endeavoured to turn the conversation that way. I 
was urged to this by two considerations. I was not sure 
but that part of our fall importation would come under 
the operation of the non-imporation act, if it took place ; 
and being fully satisfied of the friendly disposition of the 
whig party in Britain towards America, I would gladly
have availed myself of an opportunity of expressing that 
opinion to the president. But on this subject Mr. Jeffer- 
son was, of course, reserved ; though, from the few 
observations he made, I concluded that matters would 
ultimately be amicably adjusted. I was highly gratified 
by the expression of his opinion, on the character of my 
great favourite statesman Mr. Fox. Accounts had that 
morning reached Washington, that Mr. Fox was in the last 
stage of his illness. I noticed the circumstance. " Poor 
man," said Mr. Jefferson, " I fear by this time he is 
more, and his loss will be severely felt by his country- 
he is a man of the most liberal and enlightened policy- 
H friend to his country, and to the human race." 

A gentleman then called upon him, I believe general 
Eaton, and I took my leave, highly pleased with the affa- 
bility, intelligence, and good sense, of the President of 
America.`

On the 15th, at day break, I proceeded on my journey, 
through a low, swampy, barren country, where the road 
forked so often, that I travelled with difficulty; but, after 
missing my way several times, I reached Mr. Scarborough's, 
at 11 o'clock, where I found a most hospitable welcome. 

On my way, I passed many creeks and saw-mills, and 
I learned that a considerable trade, in this part of the 
country, consists in sawing timber into boards and planks, 
called lumber, and floating them down the river to a 
market. 

Mr. Scarborough has a very comfortable establishment, 
consisting of a good farm, a store, and saw-mill ; and, be- 
ing much respected, has the best trade in this part of the 
country. On going into the store, I was surprised to ob- 
serve the vast variety of articles it contained ; consisting 
of drygoods, groceries, hardware, earthenware, medicines, 
&c. I was informed, that the mode of doing business 
was to give a credit to the planters till the crop was ready 
for market, and then to take their surplus produce, con- 
sisting principally of cotton, in payment. The business 
was conducted by a discreet Englishman, and they had 
an excellent run ; but I learned that country stores had 
multiplied to such an extent, that the business was over- 
done generally, and people would need to be very cautious 
in dealing with country merchants. 

Having been most hospitably entertained by this family, 
for two days, I took my departure for Savannah, on 
Thursday, 17th July, and rode 28 miles through a very 
barren country, containing few settlements, to the house 
of a Mrs. Dunn, where I stopped for the night.`

The whole of my observations in this place tended to 
convince me, that the American character was very indif- 
ferently understood in Britain ; and, indeed, very much 
misrepresented. I was satisfied, from everything I saw 
and heard, that there was no animosity against the British 
people whatever; and that the animosity against the British 
government was the consequence of what they conceive to 
be a series of injuries long persevered in, and some of 
them even justified on the score of privilege. 

Great mistakes may be committed, by judging of the 
American character from what is to be seen in the sea- 
ports. Nothing can be more erroneous than a judgment 
so formed. The commercial cities of America are like 
those of other countries, and principle is often sacrificed 
at the shrine of commerce ; while a considerable part of 
the commerce of the United States is carried on by fo- 
reigners, each so anxious to extend the trade with his 
native country, in which he is most interested, that the 
tone of national sentiment is often lost, or but indistinctly 
seen, in the conflicting opinions which are every day pro- 
mulgated. 

To view the American character fairly, we must go into 
the interior of the country, and there the first remark will 
probably be, that the inhabitants have a spirit of indepen- 
dence, and will brook no superiority. Every man is con- 
scious of his own political importance, and will suffer none 
to treat him with disrespect. Nor is this disposition con- 
fined to one rank ; it pervades the whole, and is probably 
the best guarantee for the continuance of the liberty and 
independence of the country. 

It has been remarked, that this disposition may encou- 
rage rudeness; but I have not yet seen it. As the people 
will bend to no superiority, they really affect none ; and I 
am impressed with the belief, that it is a stranger's own 
fault, if he does not feel very happy among them.`

dangerZero.passage = `
In the evening there was a cool thunder gust, and the 
night got very close and sultry. I went to bed early ; but 
I had scarcely lain down when I found the fever come on 
with extreme violence. I was in danger of suffocation, 
and ran to the window to get fresh air; but all was still; 
there was not a breath of air stirring. I observed three 
beds in the room empty, and thought I would try an ex- 
periment. I wrapped myself up in a blanket, and taking 
all the clothes of the three beds, I threw them over me. I 
had a small bottle of Madeira wine prepared for the journey, 
of which I took a little, and laid it at my head. My pulse- 
rose to 130, and I suffered the most excruciating pain for 
about half an hour, when a profuse perspiration broke out 
and relieved me. I partook freely of the wine, and kept 
up the perspiration until morning, when the fever was 
quite gone; but I was debilitated to such a degree that I 
could hardly stand. 

On getting up, I judged it expedient to take medical 
advice, and applied to a Dr. Powell, who prescribed some 
medicine, and advised me to decline going further up the 
country at present, the season being quite too far advanced 
for travelling. He recommended to stop two or three 
days in Louisville, and then to cross over to Augusta by 
the way of Richmond Springs, where I could stop a few 
days, and in case I found I could not travel from Augusta 
on horseback, I could take the stage. This advice I re- 
solved to follow, and made my arrangements accordingly. 

Having, in consequence of this determination, a little 
time to spare, I wished to apply it to the best advantage, 
and I Mas kindly assisted by my friend Dr. Powell. He 
invited me to his house, and introduced me to Mrs. Powell, 
a very sensible judicious lady, by whom I was treated 
with marked attention. 

The doctor and his lady gave me every information 
tjtjat could be desired, and I was finally invited to take a 
bed at their house, by which means I was relieved from 
the bustle of a public tavern, and the still more disagree- 
able sting of the musquetoes with which the bedrooms 
in it were infested. 

On Friday, the 4th of July, I had quite recovered from 
rny indisposition, and walked out in the morning to see 
the state-house.`

Having been eight days in Charleston, without hearing from 
Savannah, I got much alarmed for my friend, and resolved 
to depart forth with, notwithstanding I was in a very poor 
state of health. I  accordingly engaged a passage in the 
Delight, captain Cooper, and went on board in the afternoon. 
We set sail at 5 o'clock. It was a fine clear evening, 
but I was sick, and could not enjoy the breeze nor the 
scenery. The wind was favourable, and before midnight 
we were in sight of Tybee light-house. I went to bed, 
but slept little; and when I arose in the morning, 
I found we were sailing up Savannah river with a 
fair wind, which continued till we reached the city. 

As we were drawing towards the wharf, a gentleman of 
my acquaintance passed us in a boat ; and so great 
was my anxiety, that I could hardly put the general 
question, "How are you all in Savannah ?" The answer 
was such as I dreaded: "Your friend is not very well." 
I was dreadfully agitated, and could hardly pronounce 
the sentence, " He's not dangerously ill, I hope." "He's 
pretty bad," was the reply. It went to my heart. The power 
of vision and of hearing forsook me ; my limbs tottered 
under me ; I lost all sense of recollection ; and, in 
this state, was conveyed to the wharf. But I soon 
recovered from my reverie. The powers of my mind rallied 
their force, and the passion of grief took the place of 
lethargy. I was almost choaked with the violence of my 
passion, and could hardly support myself to the top of the 
bluff, when I was accosted by a friend, who told me my 
presence was very much wanted in Savannah. This gave 
my mind a fresh direction. I armed myself with resolution, 

"That column of true majesty in man;" 

and determining to brave all difficulty and all danger, I 
made the best of my way to the house. I found my friend 
in the agonies of death. I spoke to him, but he understood 
me not. I looked in his face, but oh ! how altered. His 
eyes were sunk in his head, and his colour was quite yel- 
low. I seized his hand, and it was quite emaciated. The 
hand of death pressed heavy upon him, and all I could now 
hope for, was to make myself understood in taking a 
sorrowful farewell. I mentioned my name, on which he 
raised his eyes; he looked wistfully in my face ; he 
pressed my hand with fervor, saying faintly, "Is it you?" 
and fell back in his bed, and soon after expired! 

Thus I lost an esteemed friend, and the business lost the 
services of a valuable young man, on whom I had placed 
great reliance. His conduct, during the whole of our short 
connexion, was such as to give me every satisfaction, and 
to secure my utmost confidence. His loss was painful as 
a friend as an assistant, irretrievable. 

In the meantime the whole of the business devolved 
upon me, and such was the mass of matter through which 
I had to labour, that I hardly ever enjoyed an hour of recre- 
ation or repose for the space of two months ; and my health 
was re-established very slowly.

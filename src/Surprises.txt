On the 15th, at day-break, I proceeded on my journey, 
through a low, swampy, barren country, where the road 
forked so often, that I travelled with difficulty ; but, after 
missing my way several times, I reached Mr. Scarbo- 
rough's, at 11 o'clock, where I found a most hospitable 
welcome. 

On my way, I passed many creeks and saw-mills, and 
I learned that a considerable trade, in this part of the 
country, consists in sawing timber into boards and planks, 
called lumber, and floating them down the river to a 
market. 

Mr. Scarborough has a very comfortable establishment, 
consisting of a good farm, a store, and saw-mill ; and, be- 
ing much respected, has the best trade in this part of the 
country. On going into the store, I was surprised to ob- 
serve the vast variety of articles it contained ; consisting 
of dry -goods, groceries, hardware, earthenware, medicines, 
&amp;c. I was informed, that the mode of doing business 
was to give a credit to the planters till the crop was ready 
for market, and then to take their surplus produce, con- 
sisting principally of cotton, in payment. The business 
was conducted by a discreet Englishman, and they had 
an excellent run ; but I learned that country stores had 
multiplied to such an extent, that the business was over- 
done generally, and people would need to be very cautious 
in dealing with country merchants. 

Having been most hospitably entertained by this family, 
for two days, I took my departure for Savannah, on 
Thursday, 17th July, and rode 28 miles through a very 
barren country, containing few settlements, to the house 
of a Mrs. Dunn, where I stopped for the night.
